_This project was created as a Diploma Project by Laura Dragoi & Oana Iancu in the final year at the [University "Politehnica" of Bucharest, Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers](http://acs.pub.ro/index.php?site=prezentation&lg=english)._

**TopChat** is a _client/server_ _chat software system_ that incorporates features for supporting _collaborative communication_ between a _group of people_. One such feature is the ability of a participant in a conversation to graphically connect a message he/she is sending to the group with a previously sent message in that conversation to illustrate a _semantic connection_ between the two.

**TopChat** uses the _[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)](http://xmpp.org/)_ and was implemented in _[Java](http://java.sun.com/)_. **TopChat** runs on any _Java SE-enabled platform_.
