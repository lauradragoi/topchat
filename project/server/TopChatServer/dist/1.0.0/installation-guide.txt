
TopChatServer

Installation Guide

v1.0.0



The TopChatServer application is distributed as JAR which can be executed which requires a Java Runtime Environment.
The JRE version requirement is 1.6.

In order to launch the application the following command should be issued in the folder where the JAR is located.
	java -server -jar TopChatServer.jar

(on Windows you could simply use the launch.bat batch file provided in the distribution, provided java is in your system path).

In order to run properly the server needs some security information: a certificate, the keystore and the truststore.
These are provided in the distribution and should exist in a folder named security located in the same folder as the JAR file.

The server also needs to connect to a MySQL database to retrieve information such as authentication and save messages.


The following properties should be configured in topchatserver.properties in order for the connection to the database to work properly:

# the properties of the MySQL  server where the authentication database exists
authentication.server=127.0.0.1
authentication.db=topchatserver
authentication.user=root
authentication.pass=
authentication.table=users

# the properties of the MySQL server where the database used for saving groupchats that will be exported to XML # exists
data.simplexml.server=127.0.0.1
data.simplexml.db=topchatserver
data.simplexml.user=root
data.simplexml.pass=
data.simplexml.table=simplexml

# the properties of the  MySQL server where the database used for saving sent/received messages  exists
data.saveall.server=127.0.0.1
data.saveall.db=topchatserver
data.saveall.user=root
data.saveall.pass=
data.saveall.table=messages

In this example the same server and database was used to contain the tables required by the application.
A sql script to generate a MySQL database with the needed structure can be found in the WebApp/db folder.

The web application can be found under WebApp/topchat and should be copied into a Web Server with PHP and MySQL enabled like Apache HTTP Server. WAMP Server was used while developing the application.
The web application is currently configured to run on the same server as the MySQL server with the user name and password and table names specified above.
